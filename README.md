The way I have been studying Web-Development
About myself
Before I get main point, please let me write little bit about myself. I was born and raised in Japan. I love traveling , cinema, series , sports. I just graduated university last March. What I studied was psychology. I think psychology is interesting and useful because no matter who you are you canâ€™t live alone right ? So we have to live with another person. It means we have to communicate and when you do communicate, psychology helps you. Anyway I just moved to Canada last end of March. I am a college student in Vancouver. Iâ€™m studying Web-Development and English. Iâ€™ve been studying Web-Development (HTML,CSS,JavaScript so far) for 4 months. My one of the goal is to get job in Canada as a web-developer that is not easy but I hope I can. So this article is from my 4 months experience which is kind of short but I hope you can enjoy it!

First month
I was keeping study every day for the first month.What I did is watching YouTube especially for beginner and finding good website which has movies and we can ask them about what we can not understand.The website is Dotinstall which has lessons only in Japanese. So I studied it in Japanese (my mother tongue). And the lessons are around 2mins to 3mins that would be great for beginners. They can study something everyday even 1 lesson. The hardest part for the first month was memorizing codes. Because I tried to memorize every codes at one time. And someday I realize that is impossible. After that, I just focus on how HTML works and what I can do on HTML.

Second and Third month
I struggled to keep studying. Sometimes I felt that was boring so I set small goals and quotas which I can reach every day or week. Studying Web-Development is long way so If youâ€™ll try to study, I highly recommend you to set small goals and quotas.It helped you not only to keep your motivation but also to boost you motivation. And from the second month, I started CSS. This is interesting to me coz it was looks not cool when I used only HTML but once I used CSS, it looked much better.

Forth month
The forth month, My Web-Development class which Iâ€™m taking right now was started. What I learned were how important teamwork and how to use Figma, Trello, Github something like those basic things. Teamwork is one of the most important things even if we work as a web-developer. I had thought when I work as a web-developer, Team work is not much important. And Git made me confused so I always checked website about Git. Fortunately my class mates and our teacher helped me a lot.This month I learned so many things.This class is teaching in English obviously thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m in Vancouver. But thatâ€™s also kind of tough point for me. Furthermore I started JavaScript, JavaScript is exactly programming just as I imagined. I felt that I was just on the start line.

At the end
Now, Iâ€™m still studying Javascript. It makes me still confused but Iâ€™m sure I can handle it. After JavaScript Iâ€™m planning to getting start PHP. And I imagine how successful I will be in few years when I stumbled. I just stick to it.

Apart from programming I like Canada so far. There are a lot of beautiful nature, people are nice, multiple cultures, I can find Japanese food restaurants which are relatively expensive though. So probably Iâ€™ll live here at least for a couple of years I might have PR.

My life is so far so good ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

And please let me know if you have any recommendation about the way study , good website , any question or places where I should go. Iâ€™m looking forward to hear from you.

Thank you for reading.
